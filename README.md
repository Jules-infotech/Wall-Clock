# Tik Tok | Clock
This is a basic digital clock built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It displays the current time (hours, minutes, and seconds) and updates every second.

You can easily customize the appearance of the clock by modifying the `style.css` file. Feel free to change fonts, colors, sizes, and positioning to match your preferences.
